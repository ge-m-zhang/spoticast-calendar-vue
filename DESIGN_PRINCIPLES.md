# Design Principles

This document outlines the key design principles applied in the development of the SpoticastCalendar application.

## Architecture

### Component Structure

- **Modular Design**: The application is broken down into small, focused components with clear responsibilities
- **Composition API**: Vue 3's Composition API is used for better organization of component logic
- **Single Responsibility**: Each component, store, and utility has a single, well-defined purpose

### State Management

- **Pinia Stores**: Centralized, type-safe state management with separate stores for podcasts, episodes, calendar, and colors
- **Reactive Data Flow**: Data flows from stores to components, with actions modifying the state
- **Computed Properties**: Derived state is implemented using computed properties for efficiency

### API Integration

- **Service Layer**: API calls are abstracted in dedicated service modules
- **Authentication Flow**: Client Credentials flow for secure, server-side authentication with Spotify API
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript interfaces ensure consistency between API responses and application data

## User Interface

### Visual Design

- **Clean Interface**: Minimalist design focuses on content rather than decoration
- **Color Coding**: Podcasts are assigned distinct colors for easy identification in the calendar
- **Consistent Styling**: Uniform spacing and interaction patterns

### Interaction Design

- **Clear Selection**: Visual feedback for podcast selections
- **Modal Dialogs**: Detailed episode information presented in modal dialogs
- **Calendar Navigation**: Intuitive controls for switching between date ranges

### Responsive Design

- **Flexible Layouts**: CSS Flexbox adapts the layout to different screen sizes
- **Breakpoints**: Media queries implement different layouts for mobile and desktop views

## Accessibility

### Keyboard Navigation

- **Focus Management**: Careful tracking and restoration of focus with section-level navigation
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Support for Escape, Enter, and arrow keys

### Visual Accessibility

- **Color Contrast**: Color meets WCAG AA contrast requirements
- **Focus Indicators**: Visible focus outlines for keyboard navigation

## Performance

### Data Loading

- **Threshold-Based Loading**: Episodes are loaded when users navigate near the threshold date
- **Pagination**: Episodes are fetched in batches to avoid loading the entire podcast history
- **In-Memory Storage**: Episodes are stored in multiple access patterns (by date, by podcast ID) to minimize API requests and optimize retrieval

### Rendering Optimization

- **Computed Properties**: Vue's reactivity system efficiently updates only when dependencies change
- **Event Handling**: Event handlers are efficiently scoped to appropriate components
- **Efficient Updates**: The calendar only rerenders when its data actually changes

### Resource Management

- **Memory Management**: Event listeners and DOM modifications are properly cleaned up in component lifecycle hooks
- **Reactive Reference Management**: Vue's built-in reactivity system handles component-level memory management
- **Bundle Size**: Dependencies are chosen with consideration for bundle size

## Code Quality

### TypeScript Integration

- **Strict Typing**: Comprehensive type definitions throughout the codebase
- **Interface-First**: Data structures are defined before implementation
- **Type Guards**: Runtime type checking where necessary

### Testing Approach

- **Component Testing**: Individual component testing for isolation
- **Key Flows**: Testing of critical user journeys

### Code Organization

- **Feature Folders**: Code organized by feature rather than type
- **Consistent Naming**: Clear naming conventions for files and variables
- **Documentation**: JSDoc comments for core functions and components
